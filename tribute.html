 <div id= "tribute-info"> <p> Marie Curie was a Polish physicist and chemist, she was probably one of the most famous scientists of her time. Marie was awarded the nobel peace prize in <em>1903</em> and she went on to win another in <em>1911</em>. Marie was born in <em>Warsaw</em> on <em>November 7 1867</em>. She went to Paris to study <em>physics</em> and <em> mathematics </em> where she met her future husband Pierre Curie (professor of physics). They were married in <em> 1895</em>. The Curies worked together investigating radioactivity and building on the work of other scientists. In <em> July 1898 </em> they announced the discovery of a new chemical element called <em> Polonium</em>. At the end of the year they also announced the discovery of another element called <em> Radium </em>. Pierre later passed away in <em>1906</em> so Marie took over his teaching post, becoming the first woman to teach at the Sorbonne. She devoted herself to continuing the work they had begun together. She then received a second nobel prize for chemistry in <em> 1911</em>.
